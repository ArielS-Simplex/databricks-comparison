# FACT-VERIFICATION & CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION ANALYSIS

You are helping me implement professional-grade fact verification for a business presentation/project. Apply the confidence calibration framework to ensure credibility.

## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### STEP 1: IMPACT-BASED PRIORITIZATION
Categorize every factual claim by business impact:

**TIER 1 - CRITICAL CLAIMS** (Will affect major decisions/credibility)
- List the 5-10 most important factual claims
- These MUST be verified to 85%+ confidence
- Flag which ones could damage credibility if wrong

**TIER 2 - SUPPORTING CLAIMS** (Important but not decision-critical)  
- Contextual information that supports main points
- Needs spot-checking but not exhaustive verification
- Can accept medium confidence with disclaimers

**TIER 3 - BACKGROUND INFO** (Nice to have, low risk)
- General context, trends, background information
- Accept with clear uncertainty disclaimers
- Minimal verification needed

### STEP 2: CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
For each claim, assign confidence level:

**HIGH (85-95%)**: Multiple independent authoritative sources confirm
**MEDIUM (60-85%)**: Reputable sources with some potential variance
**LOW (30-60%)**: Single source or conflicting information  
**SPECULATION (<30%)**: Predictions, assumptions, or unverified claims

### STEP 3: VERIFICATION STRATEGY
For each Tier 1 claim, suggest:
- **Primary verification source** (official docs, government data, company reports)
- **Secondary confirmation** (independent analysis, news sources)
- **Red flags to watch for** (outdated info, biased sources, conflicts)
- **Time estimate** for verification

### STEP 4: RISK MITIGATION
Identify:
- **Claims that could be embarrassing if wrong**
- **Information that competitors might challenge**  
- **Data that executives might fact-check**
- **Statements that need expert review**

### STEP 5: PROFESSIONAL DISCLAIMERS
Suggest appropriate uncertainty language:
- For medium confidence: "Based on available data as of [date]..."
- For low confidence: "Industry analysis suggests..." 
- For speculation: "Assuming current trends continue..."
- For competitive data: "Based on publicly available information..."

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**PRIORITY VERIFICATION LIST**
1. [Critical Claim] - Confidence: LOW - Verification needed: [source suggestions]
2. [Critical Claim] - Confidence: MEDIUM - Spot check: [specific areas]

**SUGGESTED DISCLAIMERS**
- Add to slide X: "Pricing data current as of [date], subject to change"
- Add to conclusion: "Analysis based on publicly available information"

**VERIFICATION TIME ESTIMATE**
- Total effort: X hours
- Critical claims: Y hours (80% of effort)
- Spot checks: Z hours (20% of effort)

**RISK ASSESSMENT**
- Highest risk claims: [list]
- Recommended expert review areas: [list]
- Potential challenges from audience: [list]

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
Focus verification effort where it matters most. Perfect accuracy on background info is less important than rock-solid credibility on core business claims.
