### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks
1. **PDF Export** - Generate comparison reports
2. **Mobile Optimization** - Responsive design improvements
3. **Performance Optimization** - Loading states and performance enhancements
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Usage tracking and performance monitoring
5. **Additional Case Studies** - Expand library with more industry examples
6. **Interactive Demos** - Live platform demonstrations and tutorials

## Architecture
- React-based single-page application
- Component-based architecture with shared navigation
- CSS modules for styling consistency
- Interactive data visualization components

## Development Commands
- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Recent Changes
- âœ… **Feature Comparison Tables** - Added comprehensive feature-by-feature comparison with 5 categories (Core Capabilities, Integration, Performance, Security, Developer Experience)
- âœ… **Case Study Library** - Real-world implementation examples across 6 industries with detailed metrics and filtering
- âœ… **Global Search & Filtering** - Cross-content search with keyboard shortcuts and intelligent ranking
- âœ… **Enhanced Navigation** - Integrated all new components into the main navigation system
- âœ… **Professional Design System** - Consistent styling and interactive components across all sections
- âœ… **Content Database** - Structured searchable content for improved user experience

## Current Configuration
- **Default Volumes**: 20M monthly transactions, 10M monthly movements
- **Pricing Models**: $300/million transactions, $200/million movements, $0.023/GB storage
- **Platform Multipliers**: Research-based (Databricks 1.3x, Snowflake 1.5x, Fabric 1.2x)

## Latest Update
- âœ… **Fixed Navigation System** - Replaced terrible quick access menu with professional dropdown navigation + restored main section buttons
- âœ… **Platform Cost Comparison Tool** - Completely reframed ROI Calculator as a cloud platform cost comparison tool (not migration savings). Now compares Databricks, Snowflake, and Microsoft Fabric costs with proper context for choosing between cloud platforms
- âœ… **Volume-Based Data Estimator** - Added interactive business volume estimator for calculating storage and transaction requirements
- âœ… **Removed Employee References** - Cleaned all mentions of "employees" from the entire website, replaced with market/geographic data
- âœ… **Navigation UX Improvements** - Fixed dropdown hover/click behavior, added proper main section navigation with 3 prominent buttons

## Styling System Documentation

### **Tech Stack**
- **Framework**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Styling**: Custom CSS + Tailwind utilities
- **Color System**: CSS variables for consistency
- **Components**: Modular, reusable design patterns

### **CSS Files Structure**
- `src/styles/common.css` - Core styling system with CSS variables, gradients, cards
- `src/styles/buttons.css` - Button system with navigation, gradient, and platform-specific styles
- `src/App.css` - Additional utilities and animations

### **Key Design Patterns**
- **Navigation**: Two-level dropdown + main section buttons with gradients
- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue gradients with platform-specific colors (Databricks purple, Snowflake cyan)
- **Cards**: Subtle shadows with hover effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Custom sliders, tooltips with proper positioning
- **Responsive**: Tailwind grid system with professional spacing

### **CSS Variables System**
```css
--color-primary: #2563eb;          /* Blue-600 */
--color-primary-light: #3b82f6;    /* Blue-500 */
--color-databricks: #7c3aed;       /* Violet-600 */
--color-snowflake: #0ea5e9;        /* Sky-500 */
