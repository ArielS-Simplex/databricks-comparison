# ENTERPRISE DWH COMPARISON - KEY QUESTIONS FOR ACCURATE DATA
**Purpose:** Replace speculative data with specific questions to ensure executive-grade accuracy

## üéØ CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR ACCURATE COST ANALYSIS

### CURRENT STATE BASELINE (Legacy System Costs)
**What we need to know:**
1. **What is your current annual data platform spend?**
   - Software licensing costs (Oracle, Teradata, SQL Server, etc.)
   - Hardware/infrastructure costs (servers, storage, network)
   - Support and maintenance contracts
   - Personnel costs (DBAs, data engineers, operations)

2. **What are your current performance baselines?**  
   - Average query response times for typical reports
   - Concurrent user capacity during peak periods
   - Data processing throughput (GB/TB per hour)
   - System availability/uptime statistics

3. **What are your current operational constraints?**
   - Data volume processed monthly/annually
   - Peak period multipliers (Black Friday, quarter-end, etc.)
   - Compliance/regulatory requirements (SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
   - Geographic regions requiring data residency

### ACCURATE VENDOR PRICING (Replace Speculation)
**What we need to do:**
1. **Get Official Vendor Quotes** for your specific requirements:
   - Databricks: Request Azure DBU pricing with your volume commitments
   - Snowflake: Get credit pricing based on your workload patterns
   - Microsoft Fabric: Obtain CU pricing with reserved instance discounts

2. **Understand Pricing Variables:**
   - Regional pricing differences (US East vs Europe vs Asia-Pacific)
   - Contract commitment discounts (1-year vs 3-year terms)
   - Volume thresholds that trigger discount tiers
   - Support level pricing (standard vs premium vs enterprise)

3. **Document Contract Terms:**
   - Minimum commit amounts and penalties
   - Consumption overage pricing
   - Professional services and implementation costs
   - Training and certification requirements

### REALISTIC PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS (Replace Generic Numbers)
**What we need to test:**
1. **Proof-of-Concept Testing** with your actual data:
   - Use your real datasets (anonymized if needed)
   - Run your typical query workloads
   - Test peak period scenarios with realistic concurrency
   - Measure end-to-end pipeline performance

2. **Workload-Specific Metrics:**
   - ETL/ELT processing times for your data volumes
   - Query response times for your typical reports
   - Real-time analytics latency for operational dashboards
   - ML model training and inference performance

3. **Scalability Testing:**
   - Performance at 2x, 5x, 10x current data volumes
   - Concurrent user capacity under various loads
   - Auto-scaling response times and accuracy
   - Network and storage bottleneck identification

### ACCURATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING (Replace Optimistic Timelines)
**What we need to plan:**
1. **Organization-Specific Factors:**
   - Current technical team skill levels and availability
   - Data governance and security approval processes
   - Integration complexity with existing systems
   - Change management and user adoption requirements

2. **Technical Migration Complexity:**
   - Data migration volume and complexity
   - Application/report rewriting requirements  
   - Testing and validation timeframes
   - Rollback and risk mitigation planning

3. **Real Project Timelines:**
   - Pilot phase scope and duration (3-6 months typical)
   - Phased rollout plan by business unit/function
   - Production deployment and stabilization period
   - Ongoing optimization and tuning requirements

## üîç DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Week 1-2):
1. **Internal Cost Discovery:**
   - Finance team: Current annual data platform costs
   - IT operations: Performance baselines and constraints
   - Business stakeholders: Peak usage patterns and requirements

2. **Vendor Engagement:**
   - Request formal RFP responses from all three vendors
   - Schedule proof-of-concept evaluations
   - Obtain reference customer contacts for similar scale

### SHORT-TERM RESEARCH (Week 3-4):
1. **Independent Validation:**
   - Engage analyst firm for impartial cost comparison
   - Research Gartner/Forrester cost benchmark data
   - Interview peer organizations with similar implementations

2. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Document assumptions and uncertainty ranges
   - Identify decision points requiring additional data
   - Create sensitivity analysis for key variables

### PROOF-OF-CONCEPT TESTING (Month 2-3):
1. **Structured Evaluation:**
   - Standardized test scenarios across all platforms
   - Consistent data sets and query workloads
   - Objective performance measurement criteria

2. **Business Impact Analysis:**
   - User experience testing with actual business users
   - Integration testing with existing tools and processes
   - Operational support requirement assessment

## üìä QUESTIONS TO ANSWER FOR EACH PLATFORM

### DATABRICKS-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
1. What Azure commitment discounts are available for our volume?
2. How do DBU consumption patterns vary by workload type?
3. What are the real costs of Unity Catalog implementation?
4. How does Photon engine pricing affect total cost of ownership?
5. What specialized skills are required for optimal implementation?

### SNOWFLAKE-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
1. What credit consumption patterns match our query workloads?
2. How does multi-cluster warehouse scaling impact costs?
3. What data sharing costs would apply to our use cases?
4. How do storage and compute costs scale with our growth projections?
5. What are realistic migration costs from our current platform?

### MICROSOFT FABRIC-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
1. How do Capacity Unit requirements scale with our workloads?
2. What existing Microsoft licenses can be leveraged?
3. How does OneLake storage pricing compare to alternatives?
4. What Power BI integration benefits reduce total cost?
5. How mature are Fabric features for our specific use cases?

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR DATA ACCURACY

### FINANCIAL ACCURACY TARGETS:
- **Pricing Data**: 90%+ confidence with vendor-verified rates
- **ROI Calculations**: 85%+ confidence with validated baselines
- **Total Cost Projections**: Within 15% of actual implementation costs

### PERFORMANCE ACCURACY TARGETS:  
- **Benchmark Results**: Based on actual workload testing, not generic benchmarks
- **Scalability Projections**: Validated through structured proof-of-concept
- **User Experience Metrics**: Measured with real business user scenarios

### IMPLEMENTATION ACCURACY TARGETS:
- **Timeline Estimates**: Based on similar-scale reference implementations  
- **Resource Requirements**: Validated through skills assessment and training needs
- **Change Management**: Informed by organizational readiness assessment

## üìã EXECUTIVE DECISION FRAMEWORK

### DECISION CRITERIA PRIORITIZATION:
1. **Total Cost of Ownership** (weighted based on budget constraints)
2. **Performance Requirements** (weighted based on SLA commitments)  
3. **Implementation Risk** (weighted based on organizational change capacity)
4. **Strategic Alignment** (weighted based on technology roadmap)

### RISK MITIGATION PLANNING:
1. **Cost Overrun Mitigation**: Contract terms, pricing caps, phased deployment
2. **Performance Risk Mitigation**: SLA requirements, benchmark validation, rollback plans
3. **Implementation Risk Mitigation**: Pilot programs, phased rollout, expert resources
4. **Vendor Risk Mitigation**: Multi-vendor strategy, data portability, contract terms

This structured approach replaces speculation with data-driven decision making, ensuring executive confidence in the final recommendation.
