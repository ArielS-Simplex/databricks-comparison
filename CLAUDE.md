## Removed Components (Cleanup)
- ‚ùå Company-specific decision guides - Too specific, not executive-appropriate
- ‚ùå CaseStudyLibrary.js - Placeholder data, no real case studies
- ‚ùå GlobalSearch.js - Over-engineered for 5-page site
- ‚ùå 11 other redundant components with duplicate/irrelevant content
- ‚ùå All unused data files with placeholder content

## Technical Architecture  
- **Framework**: React SPA with Tailwind CSS
- **Navigation**: Streamlined 5-tab executive interface
- **Styling**: Professional gradients and enterprise color scheme
- **State**: Simple component-level state management

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Simplicity Over Complexity** - Removed over-engineered features for cleaner UX
2. **Executive Focus** - All content written for C-level audience
3. **Data Integrity** - Removed all placeholder/BS data
4. **Professional Polish** - Enterprise-grade visual design
5. **Performance** - Reduced bundle size by removing 14 unused components

## Current Production Configuration
- **Default Volumes**: 600M monthly transactions, 300M monthly movements  
- **Enterprise Pricing**: Databricks $0.40/DBU, Snowflake $3.00/credit, Fabric $0.36/CU
- **Target Audience**: C-level executives and senior management
- **Workload Profile**: Medium/Enterprise scale
- **Realistic Monthly Costs**: 
  - Fabric: $4,666/month ($56k/year) - 72% savings vs Legacy System
  - Snowflake: $5,850/month ($70k/year) - 65% savings vs Legacy System
  - Databricks: $6,630/month ($80k/year) - 60% savings vs Legacy System
