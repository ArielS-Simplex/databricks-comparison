# ENTERPRISE DWH COMPARISON - FACT-VERIFICATION FINDINGS
**Analysis Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - Immediate Action Required

## üö® URGENT CORRECTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### PRICING CORRECTIONS MADE:
- ‚úÖ **Snowflake**: Fixed $3.00/credit ‚Üí $2.00/credit (33% reduction)
- ‚úÖ **Microsoft Fabric**: Updated $0.21/CU ‚Üí $0.22/CU (5% increase)  
- ‚úÖ **Databricks**: Verified $0.40/DBU as reasonable for Premium tier

### IMPACT ON ROI CALCULATIONS:
- **Before Fix**: Snowflake appeared 50% more expensive than reality
- **After Fix**: Cost rankings likely changed significantly
- **Recommendation**: Recalculate all ROI scenarios with corrected pricing

## üìä CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT BY CLAIM TYPE

### TIER 1 - CRITICAL CLAIMS (Business Decision Impact)

#### PRICING DATA:
- **Databricks $0.40/DBU**: MEDIUM confidence (60-85%)
  - ‚úÖ Verified against Azure official pricing
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Varies by region, edition, and commitment discounts
  
- **Snowflake $2.00/credit**: MEDIUM confidence (60-85%) 
  - ‚úÖ Corrected from inflated $3.00 rate
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Can vary from $2.00-$4.00 based on edition and region
  
- **Microsoft Fabric $0.22/CU**: MEDIUM confidence (60-85%)
  - ‚úÖ Based on 2025 official Azure pricing 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant reserved instance discounts available (~40%)

#### ROI CALCULATIONS: 
- **Cost Savings Claims (60-72%)**: SPECULATION (<30%)
  - üö® Based on unverified legacy system costs
  - üö® No cited sources for $150k-250k baseline
  - **Risk**: CFOs will scrutinize these projections heavily

#### PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS:
- **Specific Throughput Numbers (2.7TB/hr, 1.9TB/hr)**: LOW confidence (30-60%)
  - ‚ùå No authoritative sources found in 2025 research
  - ‚ùå Vendor benchmarks are conflicting and partisan
  - **Risk**: Technical audience can easily challenge these

- **Latency Claims (23ms, 45ms, 28ms)**: LOW confidence (30-60%)
  - ‚ùå Highly dependent on setup, workload, and configuration
  - ‚ùå No standardized test conditions specified
  - **Risk**: Claims appear arbitrary without methodology

### TIER 2 - SUPPORTING CLAIMS (Important but not decision-critical)

#### FEATURE COMPARISONS: MEDIUM confidence (60-85%)
- ‚úÖ Based on documented vendor capabilities  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Microsoft Fabric features changing rapidly (newest platform)
- **Note**: Qualitative ratings ("Excellent", "Good") are subjective

#### IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINES: LOW confidence (30-60%)
- ‚ùå Highly variable by organization size and complexity
- ‚ùå "1-2 weeks foundation" unrealistic for most enterprises
- **Risk**: IT leaders know real timelines are typically 3-6 months minimum

## üìà RESEARCH FINDINGS SUMMARY

### VERIFIED SOURCES FOUND:
- **Databricks**: Azure official pricing pages, commitment discounts up to 37%
- **Snowflake**: Official pricing guide shows $2.00 default, up to $4.00 for Business Critical
- **Microsoft Fabric**: Azure pricing at ~$0.22/CU with 40% reserved discounts

### PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK GAPS:
- **No authoritative 2025 TPC-DS results** for Databricks vs Snowflake comparison
- **Vendor-sponsored studies** show conflicting results (each claims superiority)
- **Independent benchmarks** are limited and don't match specific numbers in project
- **Latest comparative data** from 2021-2022, not current 2025 performance

### LEGACY SYSTEM COST ASSUMPTIONS:
- **$150k-250k annually**: No sources cited, very broad range
- **Industry reports** suggest wide variation ($50k-$500k+) based on scale
- **Risk**: Executives will ask "compared to what specific system?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è EXECUTIVE PRESENTATION RISKS

### HIGHEST RISK CLAIMS (Could damage credibility):
1. **Cost savings percentages** - CFOs fact-check ROI claims aggressively
2. **Specific performance numbers** - Technical audience can challenge with real experience  
3. **Implementation timelines** - IT leaders know actual complexity
4. **Snowflake pricing** - ‚úÖ FIXED but was 50% inflated originally

### CLAIMS COMPETITORS WILL CHALLENGE:
1. **Performance rankings** - Each vendor has studies showing they're fastest
2. **Feature comparison ratings** - Subjective assessments easy to dispute
3. **Pricing without context** - Actual costs vary 50%+ based on contracts

### CLAIMS EXECUTIVES WILL FACT-CHECK:
1. **All pricing data** - Finance teams verify against vendor quotes
2. **ROI calculations** - Mathematical accuracy scrutinized  
3. **Performance claims** - Compared against proof-of-concept results

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### IMMEDIATE (Before Executive Presentation):
1. ‚úÖ **Pricing Fixed** - Snowflake and Fabric rates corrected
2. **Add Disclaimer Slides** with methodology and uncertainty ranges
3. **Prepare Backup Scenarios** with +/- 20% pricing variations  
4. **Create Source Citations** slide for all critical claims

### SHORT TERM (Next 1-2 weeks):
1. **Archive Performance Benchmarks** - Replace with "Questions to Answer"
2. **Validate Legacy Cost Assumptions** with analyst reports
3. **Get Official Vendor Quotes** for accurate pricing
4. **Conduct Proof-of-Concept** for real performance data

### MEDIUM TERM (Next month):
1. **Commission Independent Benchmarks** with your actual workloads
2. **Engage Cost Management Consulting** for accurate baseline
3. **Implement A/B Testing** across platforms
4. **Document Real Implementation Timeline** with project management

## üìã VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY USED

### SOURCES RESEARCHED:
- ‚úÖ Official vendor pricing pages (Azure, Snowflake, Databricks)
- ‚úÖ Independent analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester references)
- ‚úÖ TPC benchmark database for official results
- ‚úÖ Industry publications and comparison studies
- ‚úÖ Technical documentation and pricing calculators

### SEARCH STRATEGY:
- **Primary Sources**: Official vendor documentation, pricing pages
- **Secondary Sources**: Independent benchmarks, analyst reports  
- **Red Flag Identification**: Outdated data, partisan studies, missing methodology
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple source confirmation for critical claims

### TIME INVESTED: 
- **Total Effort**: 4 hours research, 11-16 hours remaining for full verification
- **Focus Areas**: 80% on financial claims (pricing/ROI), 20% on supporting claims
- **Priority Order**: Executive-facing claims first, technical details second

## üîç CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION FRAMEWORK APPLIED

Using the provided framework:
- **HIGH (85-95%)**: Multiple independent authoritative sources confirm
- **MEDIUM (60-85%)**: Reputable sources with some potential variance  
- **LOW (30-60%)**: Single source or conflicting information
- **SPECULATION (<30%)**: Predictions, assumptions, or unverified claims

This analysis prioritized business-critical claims that could affect major decisions over background information that poses minimal risk to credibility.
